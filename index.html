          Master classes are a great way to learn from professionals. But almost always the person who wants to get to
          the MC most of all, due to their circumstances can't these very days. They can't because they live in another
          city or country, because they can't leave their children for a long time, or because they are needed most at
          work on those days. So people's wishes will never come true, we will never meet and get to know each other.
          Although, this very meeting could change our lives. That's what our project is, we're changing lives here.

              I periodically go to various master classes. Online course is the first one for me.
              But definitely an online course is more effective and especially effective for people with very busy
              schedules and with a complete lack of free time. I have seen various online courses, but what attracts me
              to yours is the individuality that others don't have. Standard "biscuits and cream" personally do not
              attract me and therefore your course on cakes was very unusual and interesting.
