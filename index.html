          Master classes are a great way to learn from professionals. But almost always the person who wants to get to
          the MC most of all, due to their circumstances can't these very days. They can't because they live in another
          city or country, because they can't leave their children for a long time, or because they are needed most at
          work on those days. So people's wishes will never come true, we will never meet and get to know each other.
          Although, this very meeting could change our lives. That's what our project is, we're changing lives here.
